# Disclaimer: This spec file is built based on the:
# https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-improvement-proposals/blob/main/grcs/0020-knowledge-graph.md (c: a3b3144),
# and as of this writing, the structure is not verified.

# Some abstraction is used in this file to cut down on the boilerplate. Most notably, anything that begins with the
# underscore ('_') is either implicit, or otherwise not part of the spec.
#
# Following steps are required to get the result that complies with the spec:
#
# 1. All "_expand"s should be expanded/flattened.
# 2. 'types' need to be assigned to all entities:
#   - `types: [type]` for every 'type'
#   - `types: [attr]` for all elements in 'type.<key>.attr'
#   - `types: [rel]` for all elements in 'type.<key>.rel'
# 3. `v_type` value should be replaced with a relevant id from the `value_types.yaml` file.
# 4. Any relation instance (e.g. `rel_limit`) should be removed, and  a corresponding `rel_inst` entity  should be
#    created instead.
# 5. _ids should be removed as a parameter and made implicit. (e.g. by replacing the keys with it, as keys are not part
#   of the spec and are only used for organisation here.).
#
# Note, that scripts in this repo only apply the first step on load, and the rest are applied on serialization.

# Later, attr/rel types will be expected to be indexed as `attr:<key>:` and `rel:<key>:` respectively, to facilitate
# entity reuse, as that is permitted by the spec. But that is not implemented yet.
